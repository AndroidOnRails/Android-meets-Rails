# Android-meets-Rails

In this project, JSON Api is builded by ruby on rails (which is hosting on my local server) and this JSON is parsed in an Android App!!

You can host the JSON Api on your local server and code will be same for parsing into android..

Android as frontend and Rails as backend are communicating with each other via JSON..
